## 🛠️ Key Features
1. Predictive Revenue Performance & 6-Month AI Forecast
The Feature: A time-series visualisation that integrates historical transaction data with a forward-looking predictive model.

The Technical Skill: Use of Tableau’s built-in exponential smoothing to project revenue trends while accounting for seasonality.

The Business Value: Enables stakeholders to anticipate budget needs and set realistic sales targets for the upcoming two quarters.

2. AI Gold Standard Quadrant
The Feature: A feature that categorises marketing objectives (Acquisition, Retention, etc.) by their Efficiency vs. Scale.

The Technical Skill: Creation of a multi-axial scatter plot using custom calculated fields to define "Winning" vs. "Underperforming" zones.

The Business Value: Identifies high-ROI "Stars" that deserve more budget and "Drainers" that should be optimised or cut.

3. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) & Tier Analysis
The Feature: A deep-dive heatmap that segments customers based on their long-term financial value rather than a single purchase.

The Technical Skill: Advanced segmentation and cohort analysis to define "Gold," "Silver," and "Bronze" loyalty tiers.

The Business Value: Helps marketing teams tailor high-touch campaigns for premium customers while identifying "at-risk" segments for reactivation.

4. Campaign Effectiveness & Uplift Logic
The Feature: A comparative audit that measures "Actual Conversion" against "AI-Predicted Expectations."

The Technical Skill: Development of Uplift Logic—a calculated metric that quantifies the true incremental gain of a marketing campaign.

The Business Value: Provides proof of marketing "lift," ensuring that the team only claims revenue credit that wouldn't have happened naturally.

5. Multi-Touch Attribution & Funnel Impact
The Feature: A visualisation of the customer journey, identifying which channels (Social, Email, Direct) were the primary drivers of the final sale.

The Technical Skill: Data blending and funnel modelling to show the relationship between marketing reach and bottom-line impact.

The Business Value: Resolves the "attribution problem" by showing exactly where the marketing budget is most effective in the conversion funnel.
